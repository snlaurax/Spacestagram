The objective of this project was to create a webpage that pulled photos from NASA's API, displayed descriptive data, and allow users to like and unlike their favourite photos.

# Demo 

I decided to add a comment function so our users can show the photos some extra love. Below is a demo of the comment feature:

It's pretty intuitive (much like our regular social media apps) - click the heart and it'll get filled. Unlick and it will be empty again:
